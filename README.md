# Song-Rubin-JGRSE

## Description 
The repository of codes, catalog, figures related to the research on "The Spatial Relationship Between Contemporaneous Tremor Detections in Relatively Low- and High-frequency Bands".

## Contents
* The folder `/Matcode` stores the matlab codes that were used to do tremor detection and analyses.
* The folder `/Bashcode` stores the bash codes that were used to do tremor location with Hypoinverse.
* The folder `/Catalog` stores the merged low-frequency and high-frequency tremor catalogs detected using shear-wave splitting and optimal polarization direction parameters from the 13 Low-frequency Earthquake families.
* The folder `/Figure` stores all the figures in the main text and appendices of the paper.
* The folder `/FigureSI` stores all the figures in the supporting information of the paper.
